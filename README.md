Brief summary of our wep-application.

For our application we have made a CRUD for courses in which we have added some Bootstrap to add some front-end to the application.

When you first start localhost on port 8080 you will be referred to an overview of our courses, where you can see the already created
courses. In addition we also have a nav bar on the top of the page where you have the ability to navigate throughout our pages on the
application.

On this page you can choose to edit a specific course by clicking on the edit button on the corresponding line to the specific course
and then be referred to the edit course page.

Here you can choose to edit one or more lines after choice and when you are done with this you press "Update".

On the same page you can also choose to press "Delete" the specific course if you wish to the delete the specific course.

All of our data is stored on a Google Cloud Database.

As a student you can assign yourself to a course. Do this by pressing the "Join" button on the specific course you wish to enter. The Admin 
can then on the Admin page either "Decline" or "Accept" each of the students that has requested to join the course.
As of right now, there is only 1 student hard coded. So if you try to sign up for a course you will show by the name "Ole".

Lastly there has been build some of the CRUD for the teacher page. You can only Create and Read the overview of the teacher. Some login
functionality has been partly done, but none has been finalized.
